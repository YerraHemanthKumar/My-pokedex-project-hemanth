# Getting Started:

**Repo with all the assets : [PokeDex Assets](https://github.com/YerraHemanthKumar/My-pokedex-project-hemanth/)**

**Setting up the environment:**
1. Install Node.js and use `node -v` to check version.
1. IMP Note: You might need to use sudo depending on the npm configuration.
1. Install Angular CLI as `npm install -g @angular/cli`
1. Clone or download this repo.
1. Run `npm install` inside this project folder to install all dependencies.
1. Make sure you use the latest version of the CLI (upgrade guide below)
1. I have set the `serviceWorker` flag to `false` in `angular.json` : So Now there are two ways to start the server: 
  * If `false`
    * Without Service Worker
      1. Run `ng serve` to see the app in action (try `npm start` in case `ng serve` fails).
      1. Connect to app on `localhost:4200`
      (I use `ng serve -o --host 0.0.0.0` so that I can connect to the server via my Mobile device while on the same network and navigating to `<ip-address-of-server>:4200`)
    * With Service Worker
      1. Due to `angular-pwa` this can can only be viewed on production builds so use `ng build --prod --serviceWorker true` , this creates a build in `\dist` directory.
      1. To serve this you'll need http server : `npm install -g http-server`
      1. Run the server using `http-server -c-1 dist\pokedex`

  * If `true`
    * With Service Worker
      1. As service worker is enable here, it can can only be viewed on production builds so use `ng build --prod` , this creates a build in `\dist` directory.
      1. To serve this you'll need http server : `npm install -g http-server`
      1. Run the server using `http-server -c-1 dist\pokedex`

**Upgrading Angular CLI version**
* Run the below commands - use "sudo" only on Mac/ Linux.
1. `sudo npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli`
1. `npm cache clean --force`
1. `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`
